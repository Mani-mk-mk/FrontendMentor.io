### What I learned

Went with a mobile first workflow and I was able to finish developing the site pretty quickly.
I also set the font-size of html tag to 10 px and later on the conversion from px to rem was rather easier and even in the media query if i just want to resize everything i can just increase the define font-size and everything will increase accordingly.
